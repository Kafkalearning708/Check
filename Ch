It was mentioned that the application status progression is one-way — once updated, it cannot move backward.

However, in the documentation, under the Failed status, it says that if there are issues during the submission process (like missing information or internal technical faults), the user can correct the errors and resubmit the application or cancel it.

We just wanted to clarify:

Does “submission process” here refer to our API’s submit call or the downstream system’s handling?

And how should the resubmission work, considering that the status is not expected to move backward?


This would help us better understand how the remediation process is intended to work.
crmconfig.id
Got it! Here's a clear and polite version of your question you can use in the meeting:


---

Question:
We noticed that the crmconfig.id value is set at the environment level, and this seems to drive how certain values are mapped or configured in the code. We also observed that in production, both the crmconfig.id and the corresponding CRM configuration file are named similarly (e.g., “production”).

Could you help us understand how this crmconfig.id value influences the application behavior? Also, is the value always constant in production, or is it something that can vary or be changed?

Let me know if you'd like this rephrased even more simply or with more technical detail.
